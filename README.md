Rails Authentication from Scratch

This was a practice exercise for the CodeFellows Ruby on Rails bootcamp. I created authentication in a fresh Rails app from scratch, by following along with RailsCast #250. I used rails v3.2.14. This is otherwise a default rails app, with nothing omitted when performing 'rails 3.2.14 new auth'.

This exercise was a little more complicated, as it assumed some existing implementation of the rails app that I didn't expect.  It was a particularly good exercise as a result, since I had to come up with things on the fly.  I am glad to have a simple, working example of authentication handy while I try using packages to implement auth in my projects. 

The difference between this one and the original RailsCast#250 implementation of authentication is that this one makes sure to log the user in when they sign up for the first time.
